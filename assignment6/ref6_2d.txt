=Sirens, The= (Si πrens). Sea nymphs, who by their music allured
mariners to destruction. To avoid the snare when nearing their abode,
Ulysses had the ears of his companions stopped with wax, and had
himself tied to the mast of his ship. They thus sailed past in safety;
but the Sirens, thinking that their charms had lost their powers,
drowned themselves.
