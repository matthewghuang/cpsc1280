=Zeus= (ZÅ«s). The Greek name of Jupiter, the greatest god in
Grecian mythology. He was the god of the sky and its phenomena, and as
such was worshiped on the highest mountains, on which he was
enthroned. From Zeus come all changes in the sky or the winds; he is
the gatherer of the clouds which dispense fertilizing rain; and is
also the thunderer and hurler of lightning.
